Jordan Lieber Litigation/Matter Management APP.


Hello World!

This is my final project for cs50x.

This  app is a litigaiton/matter management application for attorneys.

This App has two main functionsL (1) storing matter entries and (2) searching for data entries using a table.

Litigation Management:

The litigation management tab will take you to a form wherein you can make a matter entry. You must enter date into the client and matter fields.
All other fields can be left blank.

Each matter entry can take the following data:

"""Entry_ID,
Client
Case_Name
Court
Docket_No
Parties
Outside Counsel Defendant Attorney
Opposing Counsel Plaintiff Attorney
Description
Case_Status
Upcoming_Deadlines
Notes
Date_Entry
User_ID
custom_file

Litigation Sheet:
Upon entering a matter entry, you will be taken to the litigation table.
The Entry ID and User ID columns are not visible in the tables but are searchable.


Litigation Search: here you can search throught the data by client or by multiple matters, but you cannot search by both.

Litigation Table: This is the table that shows you the data based on your search query,

The tables allow you to copy, print, print to pdf, upload as excel the table.

You can also decide which columns you want to be visible.

I hope and pray that this App will find some us someday.


Thank you for everything CS50.

This class probably changed my life.
